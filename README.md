# Music-Genre-Recognition
The project uses Deep Learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks, to recognize music genres. The dataset used in this project is the GTZAN dataset which consists of features extracted from 10 different music genres, with 100 songs of 30 seconds each. These songs are further divided into 10 parts of 3 seconds each for analysis.
